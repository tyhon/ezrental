The client’s website has simple one-page interface that provides the site visitor with contact information, operating hours, list of car brands available to rent and a contact form. The current reservation process requires the customer fill out a contact form, and the business responds with a price quote and availability. To complete the process, the customer would have to visit the rental facility to complete the reservation process and make a payment. The client will then print out a rental agreement document which provides information on the return process, roadside assistance and what to do if the vehicle is involved in an accident.
